# Data Pipeline Implementation

## Overiew

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a simple data pipeline. The pipeline showcases how to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data for further analysis or application use. The notebook is designed for educational purposes and to serve as a template for building more complex data pipelines.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries installed:
 - Python 3.x
 - Requests
 - Pandas
 - SQLite3
 - Folium
 - Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using `./setup.py` file.

## Usage
 - Open the `example_data_pipeline.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
 - Follow the cells sequentially to execute the data pipeline steps.
 - Modify the code to adapt the pipeline to your specific data sources and requirements.

## Data Sources

The example data can be sourced from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ or you can replace the data source with your own.
